# Extracting Features from Text Data with TF-IDF

This Python project demonstrates the use of Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to extract features from text data. It leverages the `TfidfVectorizer` from `scikit-learn` to analyze and identify the importance of words within a collection of documents.

## Description

TF-IDF is a statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word to a document in a collection or corpus. 

This project applies TF-IDF to a small dataset of sentences to showcase how it can be used to extract and analyze features from text data, making it a valuable tool for natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You'll also need `scikit-learn`, which can be installed via pip:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sorena-Dev/Extracting-Features-from-Text-Data-with-TF-IDF.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd Extracting-Features-from-Text-Data-with-TF-IDF
```

## Usage

To execute the program, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python Extracting\ Features\ from\ Text\ Data\ with\ TF-IDF.py
```

The script processes a predefined set of documents, calculates the TF-IDF values for each word, and prints these values alongside their corresponding features.

## Features

- Utilizes `TfidfVectorizer` from `scikit-learn` to transform text data into a matrix of TF-IDF features.
- Demonstrates the fitting and transformation of documents into feature vectors.
- Prints TF-IDF values for each significant word in the documents.

## Real-World Application Scenarios

- **Text Classification:** Improve the accuracy of algorithms in categorizing documents by topics.
- **Search Engines:** Enhance the relevance of results returned for a given query.
- **Content Recommender Systems:** Provide more personalized content suggestions based on user interest.
- **Document Clustering:** Group similar documents together, aiding in information discovery.
